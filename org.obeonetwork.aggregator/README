This project is used by the Network aggregator job to publish Aggregated update sites in 2 places :
- In bouffay to /Shares/DOCUMENTS/partage/logiciels/obeo/bundles/network/
- In the Internet to http://marketplace.obeonetwork.com/updates

How-to trigger a build: 
there is 3 types of builds
- N for nightly (integration) 
- S for stables
- R for releases

Each of these builds goes to a specific place. ( see the promote.sh file to have the paths)

by default, the N aggregation is triggered each day by hudson
by hand, choose the right build type when the build asks for a parameter

How to modify the aggregation:
- install B3 aggregator editor into your eclipse env. USE B3 v0.1.0
- modify the agregation file depending on the new update site to add to the final aggregated update site, and the OD version used
- validate and verify the b3 model file ( right clic -> validate and right clic -> verify repository
- modify IF NECESSARY the xml file in order to create a composite repo of the final aggregated update site + the redirection for the necessary third party updates sites ( eclipse release train...)
- commit your changes
